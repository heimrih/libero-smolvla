# Libero Smolvla

All training is run using the `train.sh` script.  
All evaluation is run using the `test.sh` script.

**Heads up:**  
This repository is not the actual repo from my local environment. It only contains the necessary files for code checking.
Most of the main policy are pulled directly from lerobot.

> Note:  
> The main `train.sh`script eventually points to `train.py` and the evaluation script `test.sh` points to this evaluation script`eval_LIBERO_smol.py` are also available at the main page of this repository.
> The details of the actual files are not the same in the local computer, as I cannot upload the whole repository from local due to certain circumstances.
> However if requested I would try to arrange.
