# Libero Smolvla

All training is run using the `train.sh` script.  
All evaluation is run using the `test.sh` script.

**Heads up:**  
This repository is not the actual repo from my local environment. It only contains the necessary files for code checking.

> Note:  
> The main `train.py` and evaluation script are also available at the main page of this repository.
